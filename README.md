Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, this project is a reflection of my passion for intuitive UIs, smooth animations, and performance-focused design.

✨ During the process, I discovered Aceternity UI — an incredible component library packed with modern, animated, and production-ready components. It played a huge role in shaping the layout and interactions across my site.

💫 Components I used and loved:
Container Scroll Animation – used for the Hero section
3D Pin Cards – used in the Projects section
 I integrated them with my own styles and logic to blend seamlessly into the overall theme.
